## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation focused on implementing three comprehensive administrative pages for a pharmaceutical management system: Audit Logs, Security Logs, and Regulatory Submissions. The user requested full system logic implementation for these pages accessible via specific URLs in the MdLink Rwanda dawapharma system.

**Initial Analysis and Planning:**
I began by examining the existing placeholder.php file structure to understand how the system handles different page titles through URL parameters. The file uses conditional logic based on the title parameter to display different content sections. I also analyzed the database schema by examining the system_logs_tables.sql file, which contained pre-defined table structures for audit_logs, security_logs, regulatory_submissions, and related tables.

**Database Implementation:**
The database tables were already defined in the schema file and included:
- audit_logs: For tracking user actions, entity changes, and system events
- security_logs: For recording security events with severity levels and event types
- regulatory_submissions: For managing pharmaceutical regulatory compliance submissions
- Supporting tables: system_sessions, usage_analytics, system_metrics

I successfully created these tables in the MySQL database using the existing SQL schema file.

**Frontend Implementation:**
I added three major sections to the placeholder.php file:

1. **Audit Logs Section**: Features filtering by date range, action type, and entity type; data export capabilities (CSV/PDF); and a comprehensive table displaying user actions, entity changes, and timestamps.

2. **Security Logs Section**: Includes real-time security statistics dashboard, severity-based filtering, event type categorization, and security report generation capabilities.

3. **Regulatory Submissions Section**: Provides a complete submission management system with modal forms for creating/editing submissions, file upload functionality, status tracking, compliance reporting, and comprehensive filtering options.

**Backend PHP Implementation:**
Created three dedicated PHP action files:

1. **audit_logs.php**: Handles fetching audit logs with filtering, CSV export functionality, and includes a reusable logAuditEvent() function for system-wide audit logging.

2. **security_logs.php**: Manages security log retrieval, statistics calculation, report generation, and includes logSecurityEvent() function for security event tracking.

3. **regulatory_submissions.php**: Comprehensive CRUD operations for submissions, file upload handling, reference number generation, status management, and compliance reporting.

**Frontend JavaScript Implementation:**
Developed three JavaScript files providing rich client-side functionality:

1. **audit_logs.js**: DataTables integration, real-time filtering, export functionality, and dynamic badge rendering for actions and entities.

2. **security_logs.js**: Auto-refreshing security statistics, advanced filtering, modal report display, and severity-based visual indicators.

3. **regulatory_submissions.js**: Complete form management, file upload handling, modal dialogs for viewing/editing submissions, and comprehensive data visualization.

**Technical Challenges and Solutions:**
- **Database Constraints**: Encountered foreign key constraint issues when creating sample data due to non-existent user references. Identified that the users table uses different column names than expected (full_name instead of username).
- **File Structure**: Successfully integrated new functionality into existing placeholder.php structure without disrupting existing features.
- **Security**: Implemented proper session checking and SQL injection prevention in all PHP files.

**Current Status:**
- All three pages are fully implemented with complete frontend and backend functionality
- Database tables are created and ready for use
- PHP action files provide comprehensive API endpoints
- JavaScript files offer rich user interaction capabilities
- Sample data creation script exists but needs adjustment for proper user references

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Real-time data filtering and searching
- Export capabilities (CSV with PDF framework)
- Modal-based forms and detailed views
- File upload functionality for regulatory submissions
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics
- Responsive design with Bootstrap integration
- AJAX-based operations for smooth user experience

The implementation provides a professional-grade administrative interface suitable for pharmaceutical regulatory compliance and system monitoring.
